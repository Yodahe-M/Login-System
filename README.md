# Overview
I completed this project by following online tutorials, which allowed me to learn about Python and Django interactions. This project is a straightforward web application that acts as a platform for users to carry out a few basic tasks. Users can create an account by entering their preferred username and password. They also have the ability to log in by providing their login and password. When users want to leave the website easily, they can do so by clicking the "Sign Out" option.
